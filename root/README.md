# GTAV Mods List

It's second version of my old GTAV Mods List Page project. You can find here mods that I use when I'm playing SP in GTAV

## What have changed?

Well, in this project I'm fetching mods from DB, Using ExpressJS as API, and React + Vite for frontend

## Requirements

- Terminal
- NPM
- NodeJS
- XAMPP or something other

## How to start?

Firstly clone repo using git clone, then:

- Using XAMPP or other MySQL tool, load DB from gtavmods.sql
- **npm install** (in _frontend_ and _backend/server_ folders)
- To run frontend type **npm run dev**
- To start backend go to _backend/server_ and type **node server.js**
